# Statistical-Data-Analysis-on-Body-Fat-Prediction
This repository contains the code and analysis for my Statistical Data Analysis assignment, which explores the relationship between Body Fat and Body Density using the Body Fat Prediction Dataset from Kaggle. This project demonstrates my skills in R programming, data wrangling, statistical analysis, and data visualization.

ðŸ“Š Key Features:

Descriptive Statistics: Calculated mean, median, mode, standard deviation, variance, range, quartiles, IQR, and CV for key variables.

Normality Testing: Applied the Empirical Rule, QQ-plots, and Shapiro-Wilk Test to assess normality.

Bivariate Analysis: Evaluated the strength and direction of the relationship between Body Fat and Density using Pearson correlation and regression analysis.

Visualization: Used boxplots, histograms, and scatter plots to visualize data distributions and relationships.

ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights:

Consistency: Density is more consistent than Body Fat based on a lower Coefficient of Variation (CV).

Strong Negative Correlation: Found a strong inverse relationship (r = -0.9878) between Body Fat and Density.

Normal Distribution: Density follows an approximately normal distribution based on the Shapiro-Wilk Test (p-value = 0.6571).

Tools and Technologies:
Programming Language: R
Libraries: ggplot2, dplyr, stats

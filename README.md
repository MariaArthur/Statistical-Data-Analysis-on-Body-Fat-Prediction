# 📦 Statistical Data Analysis on Body Fat Prediction

This repository contains the code and analysis for my **Statistical Data Analysis** assignment, which explores the relationship between **Body Fat** and **Body Density** using the [Body Fat Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/body-fat-prediction-dataset) from Kaggle.

This project demonstrates my skills in **R programming**, **data wrangling**, **statistical analysis**, and **data visualization**.

## 📈 Key Insights

- ✅ **Consistency:**  
  Density is more consistent than Body Fat based on a lower **Coefficient of Variation (CV)**.

- 🔁 **Strong Negative Correlation:**  
  A strong inverse relationship found between Body Fat and Density  
  **(r = -0.9878)**

- 📉 **Normal Distribution:**  
  Density approximately follows a normal distribution  
  *(Shapiro-Wilk Test p-value = 0.6571)*
